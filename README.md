# ClockShark-Data-Extractor
Uses Google Apps Script to extract the data from ClockShark CSVs.

This is one of the the scripts I use to retrieve ClockShark data and store in our Firebase Database to serve to our various internal apps.

Since ClockShark lacks an API, I decided to share some of my code in the hopes of stimulating interests in creating an open source solution to the missing API.  If there is interest, I would be more than happy to share more of my code base for working with ClockShark data.
